# Design System

The design system was built to guide Norwegian Refugee Council's (NRC) digital products, applications and websites. It was developed by the Digital Transformation team in close collaboration with NRC’s identity team and is based on our brand book and design guidelines found on the identity portal.
You can find all the elements you need to create beautiful, consistent, practical, accessible and enjoyable digital products in our design system. 
NRC’s design system will always be free, open, collaborative and evolving for those working to improve NRC’s digital universe.


## Values

The NRC is an independent humanitarian organisation helping people forced to flee. We work in new and protracted crisis across the world, where we help save lives and rebuild futures for millions of people every year. We stand up for people fleeing war and violence. We advocate and defend their rights and dignity in local communities, with national governments and in the international arena.The NRC is an independent humanitarian organisation helping people forced to flee.

At the heart of NRC, you find our core values of dedication, inclusiveness, innovation and accountability.

### NRC Brand identity

1. Dedicated
1. Inclusive
1. Innovative
1. Accountable

These values are fundamental to all our work, including how we develop NRC’s digital universe. They’re important for anyone creating digital products for NRC, whether you work for NRC or as an external supplier, partner or Open-Source contributor. And they’re important whether you’re building experiences for the people we assist, our staff, or the partners and donors that support our work. 

### Our Approach and Principles

We always aspire for NRC’s digital universe to be:

#### We Build Digital Services, not apps/websites 


A service is something that helps people to do something. Our job is to uncover user needs and build a service that meets those needs. Of course, much of that will be pages on the web, but we’re not here to build websites and apps. The digital world must connect to the real world, so we have to think about all aspects of a service and make sure they add up to something that meets the users’ needs.

#### Simple and Flexible

Our design should be lightweight and easily adapted to suit various products, applications and websites. It should be open to anyone who wishes to use it. All parts of NRC’s design system are open source, and guidelines and elements are free to use within NRC’s digital universe. 

**Light**: Lightweight and atomic design components

**Agnostic**: Technology agnostic, can be applied to any technologic framework

**Open**: Open source and free for anyone.
